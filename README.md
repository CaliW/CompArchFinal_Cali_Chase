# CompArchFinal_Snake_in_Assembly
Creators: Cali W. & Chase J.

## What did we do
For our final project in Computer Architecture we built and fully explained a snake game using MIPS assembly language in the MARS simulator. Due to the short timeline and a minimal starting understanding of the Assembly programming language, we borrowed heavily from Mitso432 and their Assembly-Snake code: [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Misto423/Assembly-Snake). 

We expanded on this code by...
We expanded on the documentaion of this project by including
- definitions, background terminology, and explanations of what assembly language is and how it's used.
- instructions for setting up a MARS/MIPS environment.
- instructions on how and when to use the MARS Bitmap Display.
- instructions on how and when to use the MARS Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator.
- explanations of hardships we encountered while learning how to make a game in a low-level programming language.
- video tutorials
- additional resources
- next steps

## Why we did this project:
We chose to make a snake game using assembly because we wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how assembly works, what it is used for and gain the unique experience of using low-level programming code for a somewhat large project, something we’ll likely never do again. We also chose to expand our project to incorporate a stronger teaching component. As newcomers to assembly we found there was a steep learning curve to even find what we needed to start the project, let alone make significant progress at times. As a result we decided to document and share our experience and findings in a tutorial format on github and through videos posted to youtube.

## Background Terminology:
Assembly code is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions (as in a 1:1 assembly statement to machine instruction pairing). A low-level programming language is one step up from machine code and works directly with the CPU. Unlike a high-level programming language like Python, Assembly does not have variables or functions, and is far less human friendly. 

Assembly code is translated into executable (usable/runnable) machine code using an assembler. For our project we used MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) as our assembler. Basically it takes the names our code uses and translates them into computer friendly 1’s and 0’s.
